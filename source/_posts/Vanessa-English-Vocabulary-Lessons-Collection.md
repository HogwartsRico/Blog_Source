## 15 By the Seat of Your Pants 

没有特定的计划,凭感觉试试看

without a clear plan 

aviation 航空

以前的航空技术没那么发达，没有雷达，塔台等。飞行员靠感觉，技术飞行。 

I don't have a plan,  i'm doing it by the seat of my pants 

我们现在把当时的短语拿到现在来了，意思就是没有特定的计划



 我们今天要学的习惯用语都来自飞机的航行。五十年前乘飞机是件惊天动地的大事，但是今天坐飞机旅行已相当于家常便饭了。美国各航空公司每天都要载运一百多万名旅客。航空事业如今这样发达的一个原因是有了无线电导航系统，但是过去在没有无线电航空信标、雷达和空中交通管制人员的时候，飞行员是怎么寻找航线的呢？他是观看地面上的铁路轨道、河流和其它陆地标记来决定航线和航向的。但是如果他穿入云层或者雨区，地面上的东西被云雾遮挡什么都看不清了，那又怎么办呢？这时飞行员就只得根据自己的直感来猜测他座下的飞机该是在什么方位了。由此而产生了这个习惯用语: **fly by the seat of one's pants**。 



大家也许早就知道pants是裤子，而seat在这儿是指裤子接触座位的部分。也就是裤子的臀部。飞行员的裤子当然不能为他的航向提供指点，fly by the seat of one's pants其实是说他在茫无依据的情况下只得凭直觉猜测他座下的飞机该往哪儿开。这个习惯用语如今被用作比喻意义。我们来听个例子。这是个美国企业家在说他去越南开办企业的经历。

> When I set up business in Vietnam I had to fly by the seat of my pants. I didn't know anybody, couldn't speak the language and had to learn the local business situation in a hurry.



他说：他在越南开办企业的时候，既不认识任何人，也不会说越南话，还得在短促的时间里了解当地的商业形势。

换句话说他是在毫无客观依傍、茫无头绪的情况下硬著头皮上马，摸索行事的。所以to fly by the seat of one's pants解释在没有客观依据、茫无头绪的情况下只得摸索行事。







当你忘记准备你的演讲，完全忘记的时候 ，你就可以这么说

I totally forget about my presentation, so i just flew（过去时态） by the seat of my pants 

presentation 开场白，演讲  ；提交; 授予; 颁发; 出示; 提出(或展示、解释等)的方式; 展示会; 介绍会; 发布会 



## 16 To Be Hit or Miss

不可预料

to have unpredictable results 



The singers new songs are really **hit or miss**.  Some are amazing and some are just okay 

这个歌手新专辑里的歌的质量真是不可预料，有的很好听，有的很难听



## 17 On the Back Burner 

次要地位,推迟 



to postpone or low priority 。 postponed 延迟;延期;展缓

推迟的或低优先级的  ， 次要地位; 搁置; 从属地位;

back burner 次要地bai位；多眼炉子的后炉眼



Back就是后边，而baiburner在这儿的是指做饭的炉子。美国的厨房里，炉台上一般都有四个炉口，前面两个，后面两个。人们往往把很快能煮好的东西放在前面炉子上煮，把一些要慢慢煮的东西放在后面的炉子上。这就是to put on the back burner这个俗语的来源。下面这个例子是一个广告公司的老板在给会计下指示：

例句-1: Joe, I know you're working on the Anderson contract, but let's put it on the back burner for now. We need your help on the new Jones contract--it's worth more than five million dollars



I'll keep it one the back burner  我把它放到后面，推迟它 

![](23.png) 

soccer足球  

I fell  like i've been on the back burner recently ,we really need to spend more quality time together 

Let's put that idea on the back burner and let's focus on this other project first 



## 18 To Be Clear Cut 

This means it is completely **free from doubt** 

 毋庸置疑

That's a pretty clear cut "no" . That means that there's no doubt the answer is no 



![](24.png) 



## 19 To Throw Off 

mean's to confuse someone or something 

把人搞糊涂，糊弄



That word is **throwing** me **off** 



The robber **threw off** the police by putting on a disguise

# 如何和别人开始一场对话

Youtube: How-To-Start-A-Conversation-In-English-With-Anyone

认识的人和不认识的人. 

## 认识的人： 

### 问过去

**What've you been up  to** lately (last weekend / recent holiday) ?

 你最近在忙些什么? 

### 问现在

What do you have going  on today ? 

**What've you got  going on today ?**  = what have  you got going on today 



### 问将来

**Do you have anything fun going on  this weekend?** 

 Do you have any plans  for easter(复活节)?  Not Much , what about you ?

注意这个问题在西方可能意味着你想要约ta，所以使用随意的语气，微笑，light tone 

intonation 语调

 	

## 不认识的人

strike up 搭讪 . strike 罢工,击,打击,走向,撞,触击 

遛狗：

甲：Aww, what a cute dog. Do you come here often?  乙：Yeah, we try to . It's a great place to walk.

甲：Aww, what a cute dog. do you live nearby? 

 

有时候别人不回答你，不要丧气，也许他们并不是个好的conversationalist. try you beat. 



需要和别人有一些练习，使用英语。

practice and practice and repetition is what's going to help you to really imorove  that skill. 

Simile is the best tool 

Sometimes when we feel nervous, our face gets really serious and we forget to simle. But something happens when you smile, you start to loosen up ,you start to feel  little more comfortable, and maybe you'll be able to remember some  of the sentences and quesions that we talked about .
